# **Storing & Extracting Data**
### Learning objectives
- Exposure to the most common data storage ecosystems.
- Learn the most common challenges around ingestion, storage, and extraction of data.
- Practice loading different types of datasources in Tableau.

# **Data Trends**
![bg fit right](https://i.redd.it/fqii2tufdgwz.jpg)

Back in 70's, when the first databases were invented, storing data was absurdly expensive. 

That has changed and consequently we are capturing exponential amounts of data.

# **Where is the data?**
![bg left](https://www.talk-business.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_300344546.jpg)

Data is generally scattered:
- `Flat files`
- `Databases`
- `Data Warehouses`
- `Data Lakes`
- `Source systems`
- `APIs`

Imagine you work for an organization that wants to start capturing their data. What would be the `pros` and the `cons` of storing their data in a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel)?

---

# **Flat Files**
![bg right](https://www.weirdgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Reading-Most-Common-File-Formats-in-Data-Science.png)

Common formats include `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, `xml`, `.avro`, `.parquet`. 


\+ Flexibility.
\- Collaboration.
\- Security.
\- Scalability.

Databases are an attempt to professionalize data storage. They are composed of spreadsheet-like tables that are related to each other. 

\+ Collaboration.
\+ Security.
\- Flexiblity.
\- Scalability.
\- Tabular.

# **Data Warehouse**

Data warehouse look and feel like a database. But they are optimized for analytics (instead of powering an application).

\+ Collaboration.
\+ Security.
\+ Scalability.
\- Flexibility.
\- Tabular.

# **Data Lake**

Data lakes are a cheaper, more flexible of data warehouses. Data doesn't need to be tabular or relational anymore. But it can get messy.

\+ Collaboration.
\+ Scalability.
\+ Flexibility.
\- Order.

# **Source Systems**

Source system is any system that captures data. You generally don't want it to live here.

\- Flexibility.
\- Centralization.

# **APIs**

APIs can be used as a secure interface to allow anybody to query data.

\+ Automation.
\+ Security.
